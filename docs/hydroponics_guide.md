## Tips and Notes

- **Potency** affects chemical output and special effects
- **Yield** determines harvest quantity (0-10 scale)
- **Production Speed** affects growth time (lower is faster)
- **Instability** at 60+ causes mutations, 80+ grants random traits
- **Cross-pollination** spreads traits between adjacent plants when enabled
- **Plant grafts** can transfer traits between species using the `graft` command
- **Autogrow mode** (Ctrl+click tray or `autogrow` command) waters and fertilizes
  each tick but drains power
- **Strange seeds** from hacked vendors have completely random properties
- Plants with **Electrical Activity** trait make better batteries
- **Replica pods** can clone dead people back to life as podpeople


## Replica Pod Cloning

Replica pods are a rare mutation of cabbage. Once a replica pod plant is fully grown, harvest it to obtain a cloning pod item. Dead players may interact with the harvested pod to create a new **podperson** clone. The clone inherits the player's DNA profile and starts life with the "podperson" role.
