# Cargo and Supply Chain System

This module implements a minimal logistics framework for ordering supplies and tracking station inventory.

## Features

- **Vendors** with simple pricing based on market demand
- **Supply orders** that arrive after a delay
- **Department inventories** stored per vendor/department
- **Market demand** controls pricing and can be adjusted dynamically

The system is intentionally lightweight but provides a foundation for more complex economic mechanics.
