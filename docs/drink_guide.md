# Station Drink Guide

This guide introduces new bartending mechanics and a collection of classic SS13 cocktails. Bartenders can combine ingredients using the `mixdrink` command when holding the required items.

## Mixing Drinks

Use the new `mixdrink` command followed by a list of ingredient IDs. If the combination matches a recipe the drink will be crafted and placed in your inventory.

Example:

```
> mixdrink rum cola
You mix a Cuba Libre.
```
