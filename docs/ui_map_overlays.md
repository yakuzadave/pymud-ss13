# Web Client Map and Overlays

The web interface can display a simple grid of rooms. Press the **Map** button to
request the layout from the server. Each cell shows the first letter of the room
name. Icons indicate important status information:

- **Lock icon** – a door in that room is locked.
- **Alert icon** – atmospheric hazards are present.
- **Zap‑off icon** – the power grid for that room is down.

The grid updates automatically whenever the server broadcasts door, atmospherics
or power events. Refresh the page if the map becomes out of sync.
