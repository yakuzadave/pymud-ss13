# Text-Based Interaction Design for PyMUD-SS13

This document outlines a structured approach for implementing text-based versions of Space Station 13 interactions in the PyMUD-SS13 project. It focuses on how to plan, model, and develop gameplay systems that translate the core SS13 experience into a purely text-driven format.

## Goals

- **Preserve Depth of Interaction** – replicate SS13 mechanics such as complex station systems, roles, and emergencies within a text-based interface.
- **Iterative Development** – build foundational features first (movement, chatting, inventory), then expand to advanced systems (engineering, medical, security).
- **Maintainability** – design modular components to allow incremental improvements without large rewrites.

## Planning Process

1. **Identify Core Interactions**
   - Survey SS13 gameplay to list essential interactions (e.g., using tools, responding to emergencies, social communication).
   - Determine which interactions provide the most depth and should be prioritized for text conversion.
2. **Define Data Models**
   - Represent items, rooms, characters, and station subsystems using YAML files or other easily editable formats found in `data/`.
   - Plan for extensible attributes so new SS13-inspired mechanics can be added without altering core structures.
3. **Command Design**
   - Extend `data/commands.yaml` with new verbs mapped to text equivalents of SS13 actions (repair, treat wounds, hack doors).
   - Use the `CommandParser` in `parser.py` to dispatch these commands to appropriate handlers.
4. **System Components**
   - Break down major SS13 subsystems (power, atmosphere, medical, security) into modular Python components under `components/`.
   - Each component should manage its own state and expose functions used by command handlers.
5. **Iterative Prototyping**
   - Start with small gameplay loops, such as navigating the station and interacting with doors.
   - Write simple text descriptions and responses to simulate station events.
   - Gradually introduce complexity like damage types, equipment, and crises as separate milestones.
6. **Testing and Balancing**
   - Use the existing `mudpy.tests.selftest` script as a basis to validate new mechanics.
   - Develop scenario tests that mimic SS13 situations (e.g., hull breaches, sabotage) to ensure systems work cohesively.
7. **WebSocket Interface**
   - Continue leveraging `mud_websocket_server.py` for real-time browser access.
   - Ensure commands and responses remain concise enough for terminal-like UI while conveying necessary detail.
8. **Documentation and Feedback**
   - Document each subsystem and command with examples in the `docs/` directory.
   - Encourage community playtesting to refine mechanics and uncover missing interactions.

## Development Roadmap

1. **Prototype Core Gameplay**
   - Implement basic movement and inventory commands using existing handlers.
   - Add fundamental roles (engineer, doctor, security) with unique command sets.
2. **Simulate Station Systems**
   - Introduce power and atmospheric management modules with textual feedback on system status.
   - Create events such as power outages or hull breaches that players must respond to via commands.
3. **Expand Social Mechanics**
   - Build chat modes (local, global, radio) to mimic SS13 communication channels.
   - Implement a communication network with intercoms and PDAs for private messages.
   - Include systems for player conflict and cooperation, such as arresting or healing other characters.
4. **Emergency Scenarios**
   - Script random events that challenge players, from simple fires to complex traitor objectives.
   - Provide text-based interfaces for consoles and devices to resolve these events.
   - Implement simple console commands such as `engconsole`, `cargoconsole` and `secconsole` for engineers, quartermasters and security officers.
5. **Polish and Iterate**
   - Continuously refine command responses, balancing detail and brevity.
   - Gather feedback on how well SS13 scenarios translate to text and adjust mechanics accordingly.

By following this plan, the PyMUD-SS13 project can progressively capture the rich gameplay of Space Station 13 in a text-first format. The emphasis on modular components and iterative milestones will help the team prioritize features while maintaining a maintainable codebase.
