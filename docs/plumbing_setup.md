# Plumbing System Setup

The plumbing system automates liquid handling for hydroponics and processing equipment.

## Building the Network

1. Craft **Fluid Ducts** from steel using the construction menu.
2. Use the **Plumbing Constructor** tool to place ducts between trays, tanks and machines.
3. Connect a water or nutrient tank as the fluid source.
4. Link ducts from the source to hydroponic trays or juicers.

## Operation

When the plumbing system is active it transfers fluids along each duct every tick.
Watering trays will gradually fill with water or nutrient solution while extractors
pull juice to attached storage tanks.  No additional commands are required once
the devices are linked.
