# tgstation-server Notes

The [tgstation-server](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-server) project manages game servers for Space Station 13. Key features that could inform this Python prototype include:

- Automated update workflow with configuration files for branches and builds.
- Service control for starting, stopping, and monitoring multiple game instances.
- Web-based administration to manage configuration and view logs.

Studying these aspects can help shape tooling for updates and server management.
