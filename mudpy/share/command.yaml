command.evaluate.debugging: true
command.evaluate.description: Evaluate a Python expression.
command.evaluate.help: For debugging purposes, you can use this to run certain
    Python language expressions within the running engine's context, though for
    safety reasons only a limited set of builtins are allowed, as well as
    objects in the mudpy package namespace and the active universe object.
    Expressions containing "__" or "lambda" are also prohobited for additional
    safety. Everything following the word "evaluate" is assumed to be a Python
    expression, and is passed to the eval() built-in, outputting a string
    representation of whatever it returns. Any exceptions are caught in an
    attempt to avoid accidentally crashing the engine. This command is mostly
