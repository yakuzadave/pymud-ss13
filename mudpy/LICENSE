===============

The mudpy project employs the ISC license, a permissive free
software license written by the Internet Systems Consortium and
functionally equivalent to the 2-clause BSD license. Initially used
for the ISC's own software releases, it has since become the
preferred license of many projects (OpenBSD, for example).
