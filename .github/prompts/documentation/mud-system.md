## Documentation Standards
1. **Player-Friendly**: Write guides that help new players understand the game
2. **Technical Accuracy**: Ensure developer documentation is precise
3. **SS13 Flavor**: Maintain the Space Station 13 atmosphere and terminology
4. **MUD Conventions**: Follow traditional MUD documentation patterns
5. **Examples**: Include command examples and gameplay scenarios

## Output Format

Generate the following documentation files:

# README.md
